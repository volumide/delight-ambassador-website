						The welfare team is a branch of the Ideation Team. The Welfare team is responsible for welcoming new members and getting their details. We are also responsible for sending motivational, educational and spiritual messages to Dla members individually. The welfare team also posts birthdays, congratulatory messages as a way of expressing genuine love for all members. Occasionally, we also organize give-away to encourage the members of Dla. Above all, the welfare team cares about the general health, happiness, safety and wellbeing of all members of Dla.
